        <h3> A Quick Example </h3>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-rust">
// Draw some multi-colored geometry to the screen
extern crate quicksilver;

    State, run,
    geom::{Circle, Rectangle, Transform},
    graphics::{Color, Sprite, Window, WindowBuilder}
};

        <p> 
            Thanks to the magic of WebAssembly, if your browser supports 
            both WebAssembly and WebGL2, then you can view the examples online
            with no plugins required.

        <h3> Supported platforms </h3>

        <p>
            The engine is supported on Windows, macOS, (somewhat) Linux, and the web via WebAssembly. 
            Linux is supported inasmuch as the libraries used for 
            graphics (glutin, gl) and sound (rodio) work correctly, 
            but no extra attempts to support exotic setups will be made. 
            The web is only supported via the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` 
            Rust target, not through emscripten. It might work with 
            emscripten but this is not an ongoing guarantee.
            <br>
            It has not been tested extensively on desktop platforms 
            other than x86, but there is no reason it should fail to 
            work. If the dependencies and the Rust compiler support a 
            platform, quicksilver should as well.
            <br>
            There are no plans to support mobile / touch-primary 
            platforms, as the paradigms are completely different. UI 
            elements must be created differently, input is one or two points
            of contact rather than primarily through a keyboard, etc. 
            <br>
            There is one exception: macOS does not currently support gamepads, see <a href = "https://gitlab.com/Arvamer/gilrs/issues/3">gilrs issue #3</a>
        </p>
        <h3> Supported Compiler Versions </h3>
        <p>
            The desktop targets should always compile and run on the latest
            stable rust. 
            Currently the web target is limited to nightly rust, because 
            the WASM target that does not require emscripten is limited 
            to nightly.
