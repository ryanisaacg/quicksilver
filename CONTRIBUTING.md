# Contributing to Quicksilver

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Quicksilver! Your support really means a lot.

There are two main ways to contribute: [opening issues](#issues) and [submitting patches](#prs).

## Issues

When you're opening an issue, generally there are three main categories.

The first is a question: how do I build this, why is this structure named this, or what does this error message mean.
Please make sure to describe your environment if you're having a problem you need help with!
Including your operating system and its version, your rust compiler version (`rustc -vV`), and any commands you may have run, as well as their output.

The second category of issue is a bug report.
Make sure to describe your environment as above, and to include a snippet of code that demonstrates the bug.
Without a way to reproduce the bug, it will be very hard to fix, so make sure to provide as much information as possible.

The third category of issue is a feature request.
Quicksilver is an evolving project that can definitely use a lot more features, and the project is very open to suggestions.
However, there is a certain category of feature that (generally) won't be considered for work: anything that will only work on one of desktop or web.
A firm goal of quicksilver is unsurprising behavior when taking a web-first project and compiling for desktop and vice-versa.
Also, there's no guarantee anyone else will be up to working on your feature request; if that's the case, then feel free to [open a PR](#prs).


## PRs

The first rule of PRs to Quicksilver is to generally try to make only a few changes in a single PR.
This way each PR maps to about one commit message, which in turn maps to one set of atomic changes to the codebase.
(There are exceptions: if you are making a PR to replace a rendering backend, there is going to be a large diff.)

Below is more information about the project organization and styleguides for Quicksilver, which is helpful to read before submitting a change.

### Branch structure

The main branch of quicksilver is `master`, which generally tracks the previous release on crates.io. Changes that are intended for the next version
are merged into `development`, and then all merged into `master` when it is time for a release.

### Git styleguide

- Use present-tense commands ("do this thing" instead of "does this thing" or "did this thing") so the git log reads like a series of patches
- Keep line lengths at 72 characters or below (for good commit formatting)
- The first line of your commit should be a summary
- Any body text should be seperated from the summary by a blank line
- When referring to an issue or pull request, use its number so that Github auto-formats it correctly

### Documenting your changes

- Add an entry in `CHANGES.md`, which can generally be the summary(s) of your git commits
- If you changed the public API, note [BREAKING] in front of your change
- Additionally, make sure you didn't break the code snippet in the website, the README, or `src/lib.rs`. If you did, make sure to update them.

### Testing your changes

- Make sure to run `cargo test` which will both verify the tests pass and also make sure the crate and all examples compile
- Make sure to run `cargo +nightly check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --examples` which will verify that the crate and all examples compile for web
- If you changed core code (rendering, sound playback, file loading) make sure to actually run any examples you affected,
on any platforms you have changed.

### Dealing with issues

- If an individual commit fixes an issue, note that at the bottom of the summary with Resolves #n, where n is the issue number.
- If a PR as a whole fixes an issue, note that at the bottom of the PR summary with the same syntax.
- If a commit or PR affects an issue but does not fix it, make sure to refer to it by number using the #n syntax so it is linked on Github.
