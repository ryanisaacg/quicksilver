//! Asset combinators (or in the general case, Future combinators) allow us to chain async
//! computations together.
//!
//! In the last tutorial, we briefly touched on asset combinators. While sometimes you want to wait
//! for a simple future to elapse (like loading a single image) sometimes you want something more,
//! like loading 2 images, loading an image then taking several subimages from it, or loading a 
//! text file then using its contents to load an image. The last example could be written:
//! ```no_run
//! use quicksilver::{
//!     Future, Result,
//!     combinators::ok,
//!     graphics::Image,
//!     lifecycle::Asset,
//!     load_file,
//! };
//! fn load_image_from_file(filename: &'static str) -> Asset<Image> {
//!     Asset::new(load_file(filename)
//!         .and_then(|contents| ok(String::from_utf8(contents).expect("The file must be UTF-8")))
//!         .and_then(|image_path| Image::load(image_path)))
//! }
//! ```
//! This example uses 2 combinators: `result` and `and_then`. `result` takes a Result type and
//! converts it into a Future that immediately resolves. `and_then` chains a Future onto the
//! previous one, if the previous one completes. If we were to re-write the Futures code here as a
//! description, it would look something like:
//! ```text
//! - First load the file at path filename
//! - When that completes, if it succeeded, convert it to UTF8
//! - When that completes, if it succeeded, start loading an image pointed to by the file
//! ```
//! The combinator module is re-exported from the `future` module of the `futures` crate, 
//!
//! **Note: Do not use the `wait` method on a `Future`; on WASM, it will panic. In the near future,
//! [when Rust has async / await](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50547), await can be
//! used in place of `wait`.
