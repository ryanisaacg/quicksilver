//! The quicksilver tutorials, generated through Rustdoc
//!
//! While this isn't a traditional way of hosting a tutorial, Rustdoc ensures that all the code in
//! the tutorials is checked when CI runs, keeping it nice and up-to-date.
//!
//! Before you jump into the tutorials below, make sure your development environment is ready. If
//! you're just targeting desktop, all you need is the latest stable Rust. If you're targeting the
//! web, make sure you install cargo-web first (cargo install -f cargo-web).
