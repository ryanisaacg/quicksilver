//! A 2D geometry module
//!
//! It contains basic shapes such as rectangles and circles, as well as vectors, lines, and a
//! universal Shape API. It also has matrix-backed Transforms for arbitrary constant-time 2D
//! transformations, such as rotating, scaling, or translating. 
//!
//! The Tilemap allows 2D storage of data in a world-like grid, and also moving objects at given
//! speeds around the map, which is highly useful for games like platformers.
